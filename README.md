Kyrgyz Number to Text Converter

This project is a Java application that converts numbers (from 0 to 999,999) into their textual representation in Kyrgyz. The program breaks down the number into individual parts (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.) and outputs the corresponding words in Kyrgyz. The project uses basic data structures, arrays, and simple data operations.

Key Features:
Supports numbers from 0 to 999,999.

Converts numbers into their textual equivalent in Kyrgyz.

Prompts the user to enter a number and ensures it is within the valid range.

How It Works:
Arrays: Used to store the textual representations of numbers (e.g., "Bir", "Eki", "On").

Conditional Statements: The program determines which range the number falls into (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and constructs the correct text.

Input Handling: The program checks if the entered number is within the range of 0 to 999,999 and prompts the user to re-enter if it is not.

Challenges:
Handling large numbers (up to 999,999) and correctly breaking them down into thousands, hundreds, and tens.

Proper text formatting (word order and spacing).

Improvements:
Initially, the program only worked with numbers up to 9,999 but was enhanced to support numbers up to 999,999.

The project does not use files for input/outputâ€”all data is entered and displayed through the console.
